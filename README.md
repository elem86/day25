# Day 25

🎯 Day 25 – One Project a Day Until I Get Hired

💡 Loan Payment Calculator in Excel

🔢 Theme: Financial Modeling – Loan Estimator

Today’s project was an interactive Loan Payment Calculator built entirely in Excel. Users can adjust the loan amount, interest rate, and term using sliders, and the sheet automatically calculates:

  - 🧮 Monthly Payment (using the PMT formula)

  - 💰 Total Payment

  - 💸 Total Interest

I also added a pie chart to visually break down the Principal vs. Interest, offering a clear look at how much you really end up paying over time.
